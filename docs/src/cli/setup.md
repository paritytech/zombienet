# Setup

This command will help you to easily download latest artifacts and make them executable in order to use them with zombienet

## Download and install needed artifacts

For easier and faster setup of local environment, you can run:

```bash
❯ zombienet setup

Setup is meant for downloading and making everything ready for dev environment of ZombieNet;

You can use the following arguments:
  binaries    the binaries that you want to be downloaded, provided in a row without any separators;
              They are downloaded in current directory and appropriate executable permissions are assigned.
              Possible options: 'polkadot', 'polkadot-parachain'
              > zombienet setup polkadot polkadot-parachain

```

Script above will retrieve the binaries provided and try to download and prepare those binaries for usage. At the end of the download, script will provide a command to run in your local environment in order to add the directory where the binaries were downloaded in your $PATH var:

e.g.

```bash
Please add the dir to your $PATH by running the command: export PATH=/home/<user>/<current_directory>/dist:$PATH
```

Command example (Linux):

```bash
➜ zombienet setup polkadot polkadot-parachain
```

```bash
Setup will start to download binaries:
- polkadot 	 Approx. size  113  MB

> Note for MacOs users: As of the time of this writing, polkadot binary is not currently supported for MacOs. As a result users of MacOS need to clone the [Polkadot repo](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot),create a release and add it in your PATH manually (setup will advice you so as well).
