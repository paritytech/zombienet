# Spawning

One of the goal of ZombieNet is easily spawn ephemeral networks, providing a simple but poweful *cli* that allow you to declare the desired network in `toml` or `json` format. You can check the [definition spec](../network-definition-spec.md) to view the available options.

A **minimal** configuration example with two validators and one parachain:

```toml
[settings]
timeout = 1000

[relaychain]
default_image = "paritypr/polkadot-debug:master"
chain = "rococo-local"

  [[relaychain.nodes]]
  name = "alice"

  [[relaychain.nodes]]
  name = "bob"

[[parachains]]
id = 100

  [parachains.collator]
  name = "collator01"
  image = "paritypr/colander:4131-ccd09bbf"
  command = "adder-collator"
```

Then you can spwan the network by running the following command:

```bash
./zombienet-macos spawn examples/0001-simple-network.toml
```

You can follow the output of the `steps` to spawn the network and once the network is launched a message with the `node`s information like this one is show

```bash

Both the `prometheus` and the `node` links are accesibles in your local machine to get the `metrics` or connect to the node.
