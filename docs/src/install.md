# Installation

ZombieNet releases are available in `github`. Each one provide an executable for both `linux` and `macos` crated with [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg) and allow to run `zombienet` cli *without* having `Node.js` installed **but** each `provider` define it's own requirements (e.g. k8s, podman).
