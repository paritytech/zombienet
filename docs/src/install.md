# Installation

ZombieNet releases are available in [github](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases). Each release provides executables for both `linux` and `macos` created with [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg) and allows running `zombienet` cli *without* having `Node.js` installed. **But** each `provider` define its own requirements (e.g. k8s, podman).
