# Zombienet

<div align="center">
<p>A cli tool to easily spawn ephemeral Polkadot/Substrate networks and perform tests against them.</p>
</div>

## :warning: :construction: Under Active Development :construction: :warning:

This project is still in early stage and very much a work in progress. More features will be added, docs may be missing or outdated and api/config may change.

NOTE: `polkadot-collator` has recently been renamed `polkadot-parachain`.

## What is Zombienet?

Zombienet aims to be a testing framework for Substrate based blockchains, providing a simple **cli** tool that allows users to spawn and test ephemeral networks. The assertions used in the tests can include on-chain storage, metrics, logs and custom javascript scripts that interact with the chain. To make it easy to define those, zombienet has a `natural language` built-in allowing developers to write tests as smooth as posible.

Internally zombienet is a `javascript` library, designed to run on NodeJS and support different backend `providers` to run the *nodes*, at this moment `kubernetes`, `podman` and `native` are supported.

## Usage

Zombienet releases are available in `github`. Each one provides an executable for both `linux` and `macos` created with [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg) and allows to run `zombienet` cli *without* having `Node.js` installed **but** each `provider` defines it's own requirements (e.g. k8s, podman).

## Status

At the moment Zombienet *only* works with `local` chains (e.g. rococo-local, polkadot-local, etc).

## Requirements by provider

### With kubernetes

Zombienet should work with any k8s cluster (e.g [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [docker-desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/), [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)) **but** you need to have `kubectl` installed to interact with your cluster.

Also, you need *permission* to create resources (e.g `namespaces`, `pods` and `cronJobs`) in the target cluster.

#### Using `Zombienet` GKE cluster (internally).

Zombienet project has it's own k8s cluster in GCP, to use it please ping [Javier](@javier:matrix.parity.io) in element to gain access and steps to use.

### With Podman

Zombienet support [Podman](https://podman.io/) *rootless* as provider, you only need to have `podman` installed in your environment to use and either set in the *network* file or with the `--provider` flag in the cli.

### With Native

Zombienet `Native` provider allows you to run the nodes as a local process in your environment. You only need to have the `binaries` used in your `network` (e.g polkador, adder-collator).
To use it either set in the *network* file or with the `--provider` flag in the cli.

**NOTE:** The `native` provider **only** use the `command` config for nodes/collators, both relative and absolute paths are supported. You can use `default_command` config to set the binary to spawn all the `nodes` in the relay chain.

*Alternative:* You can set the `command` to the binary directly if is available in your `PATH`.

## Features by provider

### kubernetes

With `k8s` zombienet use `Prometheus operator` (if it is available) to offload the `monitoring/visibility` layer, so only the network's pods are deployed by zombienet.

### Podman

With `podman` zombienet deploys a couple of extra pods to add a layer of monitoring/visibility to the running network. In particular pods for `prometheus`, `tempo` and `grafana` are deployed. Also, `grafana` is configured to have `prometheus` and `tempo` as datasource.

To access those services you can find the `url` in the output of zombinet

```bash
  Monitor: prometheus - url: http://127.0.0.1:34123

  Monitor: tempo - url: http://127.0.0.1:34125

  Monitor: grafana - url: http://127.0.0.1:41461
```

*Note*: Grafana is deployed with the default admin access.

Once the network is stopped, by ctrl+c on a running spawn or by finishing the test, these pods are removed with the rest of the pods launched by zombienet.

### Native

Native provider doesn't run any extra layer/process at the moment.

---

### Cli usage

*For this example we will use the `macos` version of the executable*

```bash
./zombienet-macos
Usage: zombienet [options] [command]

Options:
  -c, --spawn-concurrency <concurrency>  Number of concurrent spawning process to launch, default is 1
  -p, --provider <provider>              Override provider to use (choices: "podman","kubernetes", "native", default: kubernetes)
  -m, --monitor                          Start as monitor, do not auto cleanup network
  -h, --help                             display help for command

Commands:
  spawn <networkConfig> [creds]  Spawn the network defined in the config
  test <testFile>                Run tests on the network defined
  version                        Prints zombienet version
  help [command]                 display help for command
```

---

### Configuration files and examples

#### Spawning

One of the goals of `zombienet` is to easily spawn ephemeral networks, providing a simple but powerful *cli* that allows you to declare the desired network in `toml` or `json` format. You can check the [definition spec](/docs/src/network-definition-spec.md) to view the available options.

A **minimal** configuration example with two validators and one parachain:

```toml
[settings]
timeout = 1000

[relaychain]
default_image = "paritypr/polkadot-debug:master"
chain = "rococo-local"

  [[relaychain.nodes]]
  name = "alice"

  [[relaychain.nodes]]
  name = "bob"

[[parachains]]
id = 100

  [parachains.collator]
  name = "collator01"
  image = "paritypr/colander:4131-ccd09bbf"
  command = "adder-collator"
```

Then you can spwan the network by running the following command:

```bash
./zombienet-macos spawn examples/0001-small-network.toml
```

You can follow the output of the `steps` to spawn the network and once the network is launched a message with the `node`s information like this one is shown

```bash
-----------------------------------------

	 Network launched üöÄüöÄ

		 In namespace zombie-1b0ad798d89c9f7f9c610bc46849970f with kubernetes provider


		 Node name: bootnode

		 Node direct link: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A52562#/explorer

		 Node prometheus link: http://127.0.0.1:52567/metrics

---

		 Node name: alice

		 Node direct link: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A52642#/explorer

		 Node prometheus link: http://127.0.0.1:52647/metrics

---

		 Node name: bob

		 Node direct link: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A52694#/explorer

		 Node prometheus link: http://127.0.0.1:52699/metrics

---

	 Parachain ID: 100


		 Node name: collator01-1

		 Node direct link: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A52742#/explorer
```

Both the `prometheus` and the `node` links are accessible in your local machine to get the `metrics` or connect to the node.

#### Using `env` variables in network config

Zombienet can also make *replacements* in the network config using `env` variables. To define a replacement you need to use the `{{ENV_VAR_NAME}}` syntax.

For example, from the previous example but using `env` variables could be:

```toml
[relaychain]
default_image = "{{ZOMBIENET_INTEGRATION_TEST_IMAGE}}"
chain = "rococo-local"

  [[relaychain.nodes]]
  name = "alice"

  [[relaychain.nodes]]
  name = "bob"

[[parachains]]
id = 100
addToGenesis = false

  [parachains.collator]
  name = "collator01"
  image = "{{COL_IMAGE}}"
  command = "adder-collator"

```

Then you can `export` the needed values before you run the command to spawn the network again:

```bash
export ZOMBIENET_INTEGRATION_TEST_IMAGE=docker.io/paritypr/polkadot-debug:master
export COL_IMAGE=docker.io/paritypr/colander:4131-ccd09bbf

./zombienet-macos spawn examples/0001-small-network.toml
```

##### Teardown

You can teardown the network (and cleanup the used resources) by terminating the process (`Ctrl+c`).

---

#### Testing

The other goal of `zombienet` is to provide a way to perform test/assertions agins the spawned network, using a set of `natural language expressions` that allow you to make assertions based on metrics, logs and some `built-in` function that query the network usin `polkadot.js`.
Those assertions should be defined in a *feature test*, and the `dsl` and format is documented in [here](/docs/src/test-dsl-definition-spec.md).

The following is an small example to spawn a network (using the previous `simple network definition`) and assert that:
  - Both `nodes` are running
  - The defined `parachain` is registered
  - The defined `parachain` is producing blocks and produced at least 10 within 200 seconds.

```feature
Description: Simple Network Smoke Test
Network: ./0001-small-network.toml
Creds: config


alice: is up
bob: is up
alice: parachain 100 is registered within 225 seconds
alice: parachain 100 block height is at least 10 within 200 seconds
```

Other examples are provided in the [examples](examples) directory.
